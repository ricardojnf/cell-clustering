# cell-clustering

This project was developed in the Machine Learning course, where several clustering algorithms are used to group images of cells. They are images from a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy photograph of Staphylococcus aureus, a spherical bacterium, from the group of gram-positive cocci, often found on the skin and nasal passages of healthy people. However, it can cause diseases, ranging from a simple infection to serious infections.
